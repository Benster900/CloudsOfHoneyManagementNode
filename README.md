# CloudsOfHoneyManagementNode
I have always been a fan of the Modern Honey Network project but I always felt it lacked certain features. This is a fun project to develop my own honeypot network using MHN as a template. The big differences between my system and theres is an ELK backend, MariaDB backend, Logstash instead of hpfeeds, and malware retrieval and statistics. I mean no disrespect to the creators of the MHN. project.


## ELK stack



## Ansible



## Adding a new honeypot
Adding a new honeypot is relatively simple. Just create a grok parser for Logstash to have data collector. Then add any data directories to Ansible to have it grab data.


## Malware Databases


## Malware Parition


## System Requirements
